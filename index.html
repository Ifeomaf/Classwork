<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

<h2 class="underline">So what is HTML</h2>
<p>HTML is a <strong>markuplanguage</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>

<p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>The opening tag</strong>This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong> This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
    <li><strong> The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
<ol><strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.</ol>
